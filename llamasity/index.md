# Llamacity / Llamasity?
It all started in September of 2013. Andy Xue's parents were visiting the office, took a picture, and left. I don't know if anyone really saw them while they were here, but we all found out about it when Andy forwarded their email to chatter:

We've all see mispellings or mispronunciations of "Lumosity", but this one struck me funny. I immediately fired up Photoshop, and punched this out:

<br/>
<img src="images/email3.png" width="100%" alt="it begins"/>
<br/>

From there, I created many-a-llama-themed-photoshops and a few products.

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-4 small-12 columns">
    <img src="images/llama%20viking.png"/>
  </div>
  <div class="large-4 small-12 columns">
    <img src="images/what-color-llama-dress.gif"/>
  </div>

  <div class="large-4 small-12 columns">
    <img src="images/mug.png" alt="the mug"/>
  </div>
</div>

## So, you still do that whole "llama" thing?
Yes! I've grown to admire llamas over the years, and even got to meet some awesome llamas over in Oakland back in 2015 thanks to an awesome Lumosity team outing!

And that's really it! Just love llamas, that's all.
