# Ancestry.com DNA Results

{% lightbox {url: '/ancestry-dna/pictures/AncestryDNA_Ethnicity.png'} %}

I bought an Ancestry.com DNA kit a few months back, and finally completed it
and sent it back to them about 8 weeks ago. Got my results back today. No real
surprises there.

The breakdown by region was as follows:

<table style="width:100%">
<tr>
  <th>Region</th>
  <th>Percentage</th>
  <th>Range</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Europe West</td>
  <td>59%</td>
  <td>27-90%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Ireland</td>
  <td>17%</td>
  <td>0-34%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Europe East</td>
  <td>10%</td>
  <td>0-22%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Iberian Peninsula</td>
  <td>7%</td>
  <td>0-16%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Scandinavia</td>
  <td>5%</td>
  <td>0-15%</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Percentage
This is the average percentage match for the region. Ancestry.com
takes 40 known DNA measurements per region, and then pulls 40 random sample markers
from my DNA to see how closely my DNA matches the region's average DNA across those
40 measurements.

#### Range
This is the range of percentage matches across the above 40 measurements. For example,
for Europe West, I had a range of 27-90%, that means that the lowest match of one of
my DNA markers to a known DNA marker from the Europe West region was 27%. The highest
match of my DNA to one of the 40 DNA markers in the region was 90%.
