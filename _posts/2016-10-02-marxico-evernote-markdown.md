After [previously explaining](https://cfurrow.github.io/note%20taking/2016/02/16/you-lost-me-evernote) how I had switched away from Evernote, I've been back for several months now, thanks to [Marxico](http://marxi.co/).

### What is Marxico?
Marxico allows me to use my top-requested feature for Evernote that it currently lacks: Markdown! This app allows me to write notes in Markdown and then sync them to Evernote as rich-text (rendered markdown). I can write code blocks (with syntax highlighting), tables, lists, checkboxes, flow charts, and sequence diagrams without having to leave my note editor. You can even paste an image into the editor, and it'll attach it to your note, and write the Markdown-specific image tag for you. It's been a huge timesaver for me, and it kept me using Evernote which already stores thousands of notes that I've written over the last eight years or so.

The app also performs all of this really well, and my guess is because it's running on top of the excellent [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) framework, which GitHub's [Atom](https://atom.io/) editor is based on.
