A colleague sent around an article today, [Execute Like a Rookie, Lead Like a Multiplier](http://firstround.com/article/Execute-Like-a-Rookie-Lead-Like-a-Multiplier), and a number of points really resonated with me. [Liz Wiseman's](http://thewisemangroup.com/about/our-team/) many years of research and experience found that "perpetual rookies" tend to outperform their peers for fields requiring "specialized knowledge."

> Rookies are a lot faster than people with experience because they are desperate and uncomfortable. When we get comfortable, that's when we start to teach and mentor other people.

An interesting thought. I often find myself in an uncomfortable state, such as when I walk into a room, I immediately slot myself at the bottom of the intellectual totem pole without any real evidence to back the action. I think it's a technique I subconsciously use to socialize and more easily relate with others. I listen more intently, and am generally more curious than if I think I have more to say than they.

Wiseman goes on to list a few attributes of those she's identified as "rookies":

> **They are risk mitigators, not risk takers.** They learn how to operate in thin slices, test, and de-risk their progress.
>
> **They are never satisfied.** “There's an abhorrence of mediocrity that they share.”
>
> **They are curious.** They always want to learn about everything, even if it's not related to their job or immediate challenges
>
> **They are humble.** “I don't mean in the sense of low self-esteem. I mean willing to learn from anyone and everyone no matter where they are in the hierarchy.”
>
> **They are playful.** “It's not like they try to create fun amid the work. For them, their work is just fun.”

I certainly can relate to a number of those. But it also feels like anyone in the software industry should also follow these tenants, but experience proves to me that this is not the rule.

- I don't like committing to work without understanding the scope, or at least setting aside research time for "spikes" and maybe even writing some failing specs as a roadmap.
- I am never satisfied with the speed of how my code performs. Micro-optimizations are where I like to spend my free-time, but I know when to give it a rest and just "ship".
- Curious? Hard **not** to be! Not enough time in a day to learn all I want to learn.
- I'm probalby the most humble person on the planet! Possibly the entire universe!
- I feel very grateful that my work *is* fun. The challege to solve problems through software is more rewarding than I could have imagined when I started back at the age of twelve. I cannot fully appreciate what I would have been doing [had it not been for that Apple \]\[e](/about/#where-it-all-started).

I've always attributed these feelings as a lack of confidence on my part, but Wiseman's research gives me a different angle to interpret my actions. Ironically, or maybe not so ironically, I still do not believe I will change my actions. I'll still walk upon a group of peers and think everybody knows more than me, and I'm further behind in my understanding of my craft than everyone else, but, I suppose that's what makes me "hungry" to know more, and do better. Striving for constant improvement because I feel like I'm perpetually catching up.

More than anything, it's nice to know I'm not alone in being a rookie.
