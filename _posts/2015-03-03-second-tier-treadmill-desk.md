Decided to upgrade my desk, and add some additional height for the keyboard and mouse
so it's more ergonomic. I needed about six more inches of height and the
big box hard store delivered with these nice (and pricey) unfinished wooden legs.

I drilled four holes into the four corners of the new shelf board, and threaded
the legs into it with their built-in screws.

With these legs, the overall price of the desk went up considerably.

- Before legs: $15.34
- After legs: $56.29

I'm still way under the average treadmill desk price of ~$1500. The overall total
including the cost of the [treadmill I purchased](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048HS02G/)
is now at $565.29.

## Materials
- 36"x12"x1" pine shelf board => $8.94
- (4) 5x1.25x1.25" legs => $8 per leg
