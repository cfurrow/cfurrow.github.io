Just found this [Atom](https://atom.io/) package, [copy-as-rtf](https://atom.io/packages/copy-as-rtf)
that adds the ability to copy code out of Atom in RTF (rich text format), which
you can then paste into Evernote for some syntax highlighting.

## How to use

### 1. Install copy-as-rtf in the atom "Install Packages" screen under your Atom preferences.

### 2. Select some code you want to copy into Evernote, and press ⌘+⌥+R to copy the code as RTF

### 3. Open Evernote, and paste. I like to indent the code at least one time via ⌘+⇧+]

Done!
