# Why Things?

<img src="/assets/photos/2016.01.19-things/thingslogo.png" width="128px" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>

I've tried a number of list management apps over the last ten years, but I always come back to [Cultured Code's Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) app. Things was the first task-list app I'd ever tried back in 2008. It has the simplicity and organization that I need, but it's not without fault.

## What I Love

Below are a quick-hit list of things I really love about Things. Although, as I've found out while writing this all down is that there are some intrinsic  parts of the app that I cannot fully explain. Suffice it to say that I may just be bias or partial to Things because it works for me, but maybe it won't work for you.

### Keyboard shortcuts

The shortcuts for Things have always been a huge draw for me.

- Want to create a new item from anywhere? Type ⌘-Shift-Space
- Want to set the current item as due today? Press ⌘-T
- Want to reschedule the current item to tomorrow? Press ⌘-R, then press Return right away.
- Want to reschedule the current item to five days from now? Press ⌘-R, 5, then press Return.
- Press ⌘-. to mark the current item as completed
- Press ⌥-Del to mark the current item as canceled

Other apps I've tried also have decent keyboard shortcuts, but I've never found them to be quite as nice as Things.

### Inbox, Today, Scheduled, Next

Your tasks can be put in a variety of places, but for optimal Getting-Things-Done (GTD), you'll want to follow the guide.

- New items without a project go in your "Inbox"
- Items to complete today go in the "Today" area
- See all items you have given due-dates in the "Scheduled" area.
- Set up your next few days by putting items in your "Next" area.

At the beginning of each day I attempt to go through my Inbox and my Next areas to file items, and determine which tasks I want to start today or which tasks I need to schedule for a future date. I may also push items into projects I've setup and give the tasks some tags so they are grouped logically.

This system has worked well for me, and I still tinker with how many tasks I allow in my "Today" area, and which tasks I defer (reschedule) into "Next" or with a due date of the following day. I feel that this keeps me sane, and on task, coupled with [my extensive Evernote rituals.](/2015/01/25/how-i-evernote/)

This organization of items is not new, or unique to Things, but it is unique to most of the apps I've tried that typically sort by "Today" and "Projects" only. You may get lucky and get a "Scheduled" or week-view.

### Rescheduling (on desktop)
I love the "re-schedule" ability on the OSX app. Hitting ⌘-R and setting a new due-date for an item is wonderfully fast. This is perfect for items I didn't complete today, but want to get to first-thing tomorrow. While this works great on the desktop app, there is no such thing on mobile. See my wish list at the end.

## Other apps I've tried

Like most things that I love, I've had to try a number of other competitors/rivals out there to figure out which app sits at the top. I do this with fitness trackers (potentially a future blog post), note-taking apps, and IDEs/code editors. I'll highlight a little about each app attempting to target what I liked, and didn't like, about each.

### [Microsoft OneNote](http://onenote.com)
This was the very first to do list app I'd tried back in 2005. I created a single note for my week, and at the very top of the note was the master-list of tasks I wanted to complete that week--I'd add, remove and complete items constantly throughout the week. Below the list was all my notes from the week, broken up by large headings per day in descending order. As in "today's" notes would be right under the list, and if you scrolled down further, you'd see yesterday's notes, etc.

This worked well for the most part. But the app was built to be so much more than just a to do list tracker, which was nice, but when I wanted to add a quick note, I had to search through a few menus/projects to find the list I wanted, and then add to it. I want immediate access to my list and OneNote did not offer that.

### [Evernote](http://evernote.com)
While I love Evernote for all things note-taking, I had the same complaints with it, as I do with Microsoft OneNote. The app is great for note management, but it is not easy for it to be an at-a-glance to do list app. You have to navigate through the notes interface to even find your list, and then you have to jump through a few small hoops to edit/create a list.

I do not like their Reminder feature, either. You can mark an entire note as a Reminder, and set a date/time to be reminded. That's good for one-off, but it's not for list-making.

### [TeuxDeux](https://teuxdeux.com/)

<img src="/assets/photos/2016.01.19-things/teuxdeux.png" width="100%" />

What [TeuxDeux](https://teuxdeux.com/) ("to do") does really well is capacity-planning. The whole point of TeuxDeux is to see each of your days in a week, and what you've scheduled to do each day. Shifting between days and prioritizing is a breeze.

My main complaints with TeuxDeux is task details. There isn't a way to add much detail to a specific task with the limited space you get in the UI. That's great for keeping things simple, short, to the point, but sometimes I need those details, and it's not possible. I wouldn't change TeuxDeux because of that--I think they have a clear purpose and way of managing tasks. It doesn't work for me, however. I want it to, but it doesn't.

### [Todoist](https://en.todoist.com/)

<img src="/assets/photos/2016.01.19-things/todoist.jpg" width="100%" />

[Todoist](https://todoist.com) is another go-to app I try when I think Things is not working for me at the moment. The app is full-featured, and contains features I wish Things had, like hierarchical tasks, comment list, etc. I recently ended a 9-month stint using Todoist to go back to Things, and this is what sparked this whole blog post. The problem I have is that I don't really have any major complaints with Todoist, but I prefer the Things UI and the majority of their shortcuts. The flow is pretty similar between the two apps, but since I started with Things so long ago, I pine for its behavior, even with its flaws.

### [Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com/)

<img src="/assets/photos/2016.01.19-things/wunderlist.jpg" width="100%" />

[Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com/) is a great, full-featured to do app that I try for long periods of time, but then give up and go back to Things. I don't know what I find "wrong" with Wunderlist, as it has a lot of features that I wish Things had, but something about the flow, and perhaps the shortcuts, are not Things-like, and that is why I abandon it. The team behind Wunderlist are constantly updating the app, and adding new features across all platforms, which is awesome and is one of the reasons I fire the app back up again and give it a go. But after a few weeks/months, I feel the pull back to Things, and abandon Wunderlist.

### [Clear](http://realmacsoftware.com/clear/)

<img src="/assets/photos/2016.01.19-things/clear.jpg" width="100%" />

I *love* [Clear](http://realmacsoftware.com/clear/). It's simple, the swipes are intuitive, the visuals are delightful, you can create multiple lists/projects. But, for my needs, it's too simple. It has one way of organizing lists, and if it works for you, it really works. Every few months I try it out again to see if I can switch, but I've not been able to. I would need the ability to add more detail per item than what Clear offers at this time. I think that would break it's beautiful feature-set, however.

## Things Wish list

Things v3 is coming out soon-ish (maybe in 2016?), and I don't know a single new feature that is inbound, but I'm hopeful for a few changes noted below.

### Swiping!
Things was created before swiping became popular as a way to perform quick-actions on mobile. I would love it if the next version of Things on desktop and mobile had swipe abilities.

- Swipe right to mark as complete
- Swipe far right to cancel
- Swipe left to push item to tomorrow
- Swipe far left to push item to specific date (or move to 'Someday')

### Comments / Note list
While Things offers the ability to add notes to a single item, it is a single textbox. To add running notes to an item, means you have to come up with your own mechanism for this. I like adding notes as I go along, and having a timestamp of each note is helpful to me, so I add my own before each note, and add newlines underneath to look like a timeline. This works, but I'd prefer it if I could add notes or comments as separate items, like [Todoist](https://en.todoist.com/).

### Hierarchical items or in-place projects
A lot of work that I do is multi-stepped. And sometimes creating a new project in Things is "heavier" than I would like.

- Create the project, give it a name
- (optional) Place it in an area of responsibility
- (optional) Add due date information
- Show in "Today" view
- Add items

What I'd rather do is be looking at a list of items, either in the Today view, or wherever I'm at, and then create a new item, and then create sub-items underneath it. If I were to complete the top-most item, it would mark all sub-items as completed, or, perhaps mark any unchecked items underneath as "canceled".

### Less tapping on mobile
Getting around on the mobile app is much more cumbersome than the desktop application. You have to "tap into" so many menus and sub-screens, it makes the whole process cumbersome.

For example, to edit a due date to say, move something to tomorrow:

- Tap on item
- Tap "Don't show in Today"
- Tap edit
- Tap the date
- Select a date
- Tap save
- Tap done
- Tap the "back" button (top left)

Getting to your project list to see items therein is an equally frustrating ordeal. It is not smooth to go from one list (Today) to a project list. It will take about three taps, and sub-second waits for swipe animations, but trust me, after a while it feels very laggy when you want to do a quick add or review.

## What's your favorite? Why?

I'd love to hear about what to do app you love, and why. Perhaps I've overlooked a killer feature in an app listed above? Perhaps I've missed a killer to do app that I really must try. Let me know by sending me a link.
