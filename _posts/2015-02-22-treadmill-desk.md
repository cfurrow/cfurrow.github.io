## Materials

- 36"x12"x1" pine shelf board => $8.94
- 4x Screws Eyes 1 5/8" => $3.92
- Two 36" bungie cords => $2.48

All totaled, this desk plus [my existing treadmill](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048HS02G/)
puts the cost of this treadmill desk at $524.34. Not too bad.

## Step 1: Drill them holes

I used a 3/16" drill bit, and bore 4 holes, two on each end, of the shelf board.

## Step 2: Screw them eyes

I then took my screw eyes, and screwed them in, one to each hole I just drilled.

## Step 3: Strap it in

I layed the board over the treadmill's arms, then attached the bungie cords to the opposite site.
