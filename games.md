Below is a list of games, soon-to-be-games or prototypes that I've been tinkering with.

## Phaser.js

[Phaser.js](http://phaser.io/) is an incredible 2D game library built on top of [PIXI.js](http://www.pixijs.com/) that can help you build some
pretty interesting games for the browser.

## PICO-8
[PICO-8](http://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) is a fantasy console for making, sharing and playing tiny games and other computer programs. When you turn it on, the machine greets you with a shell for typing in Lua commands and provides simple built-in tools for creating your own cartridges.
